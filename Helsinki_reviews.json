Over a long evening, I might spend \u20ac35-\u20ac50.","1":"What a fun place! We stumbled upon it by chance, just as we were looking for a bar to take a few shots of vodka before party. What a nice surprise it was. We spent 4 nights in Helsinki, at a dance event. For 3 of those dance nights, we prepped at the bar!","2":"Great place for quick shots. Really nice combination. The staff really nice and welcoming.","3":"Spin the wheel and take the shot you get \ud83d\ude1d\ud83e\udd18.\nSuper cool, small, cozy shot station \ud83d\ude0e\nAnd cocktails are breathtaking \u2764\ufe0f\nAmazing staff, everyone feels welcome there \ud83d\ude0e","4":"Drinks were perfect and Ida is AMAZING at her art (new friend!).
