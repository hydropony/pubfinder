place for individuals and small groups looking for a place to meet in the afternoon, start the night, or end their evening ... at 0200. \u2026","What a fun place! We stumbled upon it by chance, just as we were looking for a bar to take a few shots of vodka before party. What a nice surprise it was. We spent 4 nights in Helsinki, at a dance event. For 3 of those dance nights, we prepped at the bar!","Great place for quick shots. Really nice combination. The staff really nice and welcoming.","Spin the wheel and take the shot you get \ud83d\ude1d\ud83e\udd18.\nSuper cool, small, cozy shot station \ud83d\ude0e\nAnd cocktails are breathtaking \u2764\ufe0f\nAmazing staff, everyone feels welcome there \ud83d\ude0e \u2026","Drinks were perfect and Ida is AMAZING at her art (new friend!). Love the concept and variety of drinks. She makes drinks  Really cool bar!! Awesome playlist \ud83d\ude42 HIGHLY recommended! \u2026","Fun little shot bar in the heart of Helsinki. Quiet night when I attended so service was amazing. One should spin the wheel to determine your shot. I gave the wheel a few spins on my birthday. Friendly staff, all spoke English.","Great if all you want is shots. Amazing selection, and all delicious. Fun, and a fun perk for the night, if not the place you'll spend all night at. I'd suggest getting a tray of something tasty, and heading out to a night of clubbing!","The rudest service ever + we were kicked out for some reason earlier than they closed, because they needed to \u201cclean the pub\u201d. So we (a group of polite people) could not even properly say goodbye to each other! The waitress was screaming at us, calling bad words etc. Shocked! Never knew it\u2019s possible in Finland","Perfect dive bar and called Shot Bar for a reason! This place felt like such a throwback to early 2000s with the eclectic decor and music choices. Excellent service, mixed crowd and everyone seemed to be having so much fun! \u2026","Huge selection of shots! Fast and friendly service! Perfect!","We were told politely 30 minutes before closing to finish our drinks and leave ASAP. 15 minutes before closing lady started shouting on us that she needs to clean the place and we have to leave now.","The owner is amazing. The place has this very warm and friendly atmosphere   I had the best Espresso Martini of my life in this bar. Awesome cocktails and shots.","Great bar,  good beer, nice music","Absolutely the best bar in town. A must visit place everytime you're in the town. Various different shots and coctails served in an exellent atmosphere!","Fun place! The cocktails were delicious (Summer Twist was good, I recommend!) and the music was very catchy. It was a bit hard to talk over it, though. Had to yell to be heard. Oh and the bartender lass was nice. :)","Spin the wheel and have a shot!\n\nNice bartender.","Great shots, both in taste and looks (important part), nice and cozy interior. Nice staff.","I like this idea of a shot bar. It is for people wandering through city center visiting bars which in many cases are so similar. This one is a bit different. Premises are quite small, though, and it's hardly a place for whole evening. \u2026","Good service, as always, good shots, as always, and funny shot wheel to contribute the good atmosphere","Interesting concept, but didn't find the shots very special","Johanna was best bar tender ever!!!! She was very personable. Gives you reason to live in Helsinki.  GO THERE and have an Orgasm !!!!","A good shot bar in Helsinki. A large variety of shots\/drinks available.","Wheel of random shots is a lot of fun, especially if the bar tender offers you another spin out of sympathy. Alien brain hemorrhage looks amazing, taste is another matter.","Amazing place!!! Great drinks and great vibe. Just go!","Fun place and great selection of shots! Prices are reasonable and the shot spinning wheel is pretty cool. And the paddle of shots. Check it out!","Perfect place to start a night with a group. Great service and a big selection. Good location, but a small space. Remember to spin the wheel!","Surprisingly many interesting and different shots. Good location and friendly staff. Small place and you can be in and out really quickly.","Best place to start\/end the party i Helsinki! Hundreds of of different shots, and the (un)lucky wheel, are the highlights.","Fun shots, great location, usually great house music too. A bit on the expensive side, but that's to be expected in the heart of helsinki","Awesome staff, decent prices, good shots. If you don't spin the shot-wheel, then have you really been to Helsinki?","Nice shots and fair price for Helsinki. They have good selection of shots and different mixtures.","Nice small place.. maybe too small for a big group","Good service with great conversations, would go again.","Great variety of fun and tasty shots. We had a lot of fun!","Was a good vibe, fun place, great bartender. More of the younger crowd I think, but well worth it to drop in and taste a few of the Bartenders creations.","There's so much choices! Prices go from 5e to up. If you like shots, you'll love this place!","Loved d place.. great music.. fun shots and spinning the wheel to choose the shots is pretty exciting too.. huge range of shots and great ambience","Nice place to chill around!","Cosy and nice place","A bit dindgy and music is super loud so would not stay here","definitely a good place to go, honestly it was my first time but not the last time to visit.","Very small cramped area, slightly over priced drinks , staff was very unpleasant and rude. Would NOT reccoment this place to anyone.","Great customer service. Positive feeling. Good shots! B52 all the way.","Lots of fun here! Great staff and crazy drinks!!!!","Great place! A bit expensive and small on space, but great for groups of friends.","Love the atmosphere! I've never been to a bar that specializes in shots before, it was a great time","Great place to get hammered. Remember to carry your sense of humour with you when you visit the place.","Lovely cocktail's and shot's \ud83d\ude0d \u2026","Weird shot bar in center of Helsinki. Feels like walking into a Mediterranean local youth club.","Jest want to say Hi to beautiful Hungarian giro that works  there on the bar","Pretty small but worth the visit","Epic shot wheel and great customer service. Also huge variety in shots is a plus.","Amazing service, great drinks.

I will come again","We came with big group friends and at first we already saw the security guard accepting money to other customers and hid it fast and the security guard was so racist and mean to our black friend, because some of our friend didnt buy drinks because they can\u2019t drink and security guard kick them out.","The Beer is good but very expensive. Didn't really match the vibe of a fancy place or a brewery specifically to justify the prices but it's very cozy. Would recommend to go there if paying 8,5-10\u20ac for a beer is not a problem.","I had to seat myself after waiting for a few minutes. I sat for approx 20 minutes without being served or even offered water. Went to the bar to order was told someone would come over. No one did. So I left and went to the Kuusi Palaa restaurant much better atmosphere, I was greeted and seated and served as expected.","Nice place, typical pub. Clean friendly staff. Burgers were decent. Try the Reindeer burger!","Great place for a burger and beer. They should consider importing Stone brewery beers from the US :)","Good ambience. The hamburguers were very good. There was a problem with one of our IPA beers, with a taste of bleach. We said that to the waiters and they changed the beer.","Food was tasty and really yummy. Had a reindeer burger with fries and a non alcoholic beer. You can sit outside.\nUnfortunately one star minus because it took quite a while to order and you \u2026","Bad cost benefit. The burger has a strange and cheap tasting sauce (in particular the mayo tastes super cheap) and the meat was ok (not to the standard one would expect from a $20 burger though). The fries were excelent. The ketchup (or whatever the tomato sauce was) tasted like tomato paste with some poor seasoning.","We were there only for lunch, having the a chicken salad with pine nuts, beetroot cous cous and a mint yoghurt dip which was nothing short of epic. Well worth a look \ud83d\udc4d \u2026","Highly over-priced burgers and sides. It took 30mins for our 2 burgers and we were only ones eating.

The service was friendly but it took quite a long time for someone to acknowledge us.  I ordered the burger medium and when I received it, it didn't have much flavor.

The staff are friendly, welcoming and all speak a good level of English. Been here a few times and would go back as it's close to \u2026","The place was excellent five years ago. Now the quality on burgers, fries and even the ketchup has gone down. I had once argued that this was the best place for burgers in Helsinki, but now it is only a worth for having few nice beers.","This used to be very good. Especially the sides were known. On my last visit though the sweet potatoes were semi burned. Polenta fries were in bigger pieces and not as crispy as before. The burgers are still quite good. Pretty good selection of drinks.","Great beer, great ambiance, good service, mediocre food.  Many websites rate these burgers as the best in Helsinki.  This isn't even the best burger on the block.  I'd bring friends for beer and live music.  I don't think I'd ever come back for a meal.","Many tables available, but they let us wait for 15 minutes.\nThey have reindeer and moose hamburgers plus the common ones, to me wasn't the best taste.\nPrices a little bit high.","Decent beer selection, but I felt the service was a bit rude. I spoke English to the bartenders, but they refused to answer in English and spoke to me in Finnish. In a central location in Helsinki, this is odd. They also had trouble \u2026","The veg burger i tried was great but pricy","Nice place to eat with friendly English speaking staff.","Good selection of beers and food. Expensive even by Helsinki standards","Such a cool place! Their burgers are awesome and not so expensive. 16\u20ac for a superb burger is awesome! \u2026","Really bad. On a Saturday just 2 people at the restaurant for so many tourist and locals.\nThere is no kids menu, and more than 50 minutes waiting for a burger \ud83c\udf54. \u2026","For a cheeseburger that is 17.50 EUR excluding any sides, one would think that they would at least bother to include a slice of tomato and some lettuce on the burger. But no. It is definitely overpriced and is meant for tourists most \u2026","It's okay. The staff was pretty friendly. The burgers come with nothing for a side which I found odd; we ordered salad and fries separately. We also paid for tap water. It also took almost an hour for our three burgers and they were not busy."],"80":["ORION CINEMA DEAL!!! - IMPORTANT!!!

Nice variety of beer selection (not just IPOs). It's worth stopping by!!","A nice and clean basic bar with excellent music playing in the background, there is even a jukebox. The prices are right. Drinks can be found everywhere, from the basic stuff to the slightly more special ones. In summer, a small terrace on the street. Live music regularly and irregularly.

No max limit of players is mentioned, only after you pay for the shoes and for narikka, they tell you max 5 players. Tried to immediately get a refund, manager said no.
