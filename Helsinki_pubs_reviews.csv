I came here to watch a football match between Romania and Belgium with my friends. There is only a unisex WC on the main floor which has no toilet seats. Upstairs there is a women's toilet where 3/4 stalls also have no seat and all the floors are wet.\n\nThere is only one seat in one stall in the women's WC as of 22.6.2024.\n\nIf you want to attract female customers, which would in turn attract more customers in general, you would do well to at least offer the basic necessities for female customers.\n\nI do not feel comfortable or welcome here at the time being.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting."", 'time': '3 months ago'}, {'author': 'GB', 'rating': 5, 'text': 'Wow, I‚Äôm surprised this place is rated so low.

It's the perfect destination for sports enthusiasts, as the establishment offers numerous screens showcasing a wide range of sporting events. Personally, I visited to catch the F1 race, and I was not disappointed. The staff were exceptionally welcoming and attentive, ensuring that every guest felt comfortable and well-cared for.\n\nOne aspect that particularly stood out to me was the unique detail of having the beer glasses adorned with printed designs on top. This small touch added an extra element of charm and creativity to the overall experience. It's clear that the establishment pays attention to even the finest details, contributing to the overall enjoyment of the visit.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this pub to anyone seeking a delightful blend of Irish ambiance, a lively sports-watching atmosphere, and good service."", 'time': 'a year ago'}]"
